For now let it be just peace of scripts

        -a
            Compiles your 1.c/1.cpp file, runs it with given params 
            and echos End code. Usefull when you are recompiling coding small
            projects every now and then
        -asm
            Same, but does it with 1.asm in .intel_syntax noprefix

            They gave me dis in Uni, they told it compiles asm. Never tested XD
