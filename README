So im BE4R

Dis contains some scripts to make sure they`re safe
Also im practicing github :)
At some point i`ll post c/asm coded excercises and tasks from MSU CMC
For now let it be just peace of scripts



LS:
  misc:
    -a1 
        Shows file descriptors used by process named 'a.out' (def. gcc name)
    -det.py
        Calculates Kramers determinant: slowly but surely
    -draw.sh
        Progressbar
    -entry
        Prints entry point of ELF executable: address and function name
    -hacker.sh
        TFW u r Ne0 from M4TR1X - da coolest haxx0r in da history
    -wut...
        some /etc/shadow 4lulz
    compile:
        -a
            Compiles your 1.c/1.cpp file, runs it with given params 
            and echos End code. Usefull when you are recompiling coding small
            projects every now and then
        -asm
            Same, but does it with 1.asm in .intel_syntax noprefix
        -build_asm.sh
            They gave me dis in Uni, they told it compiles asm. Never tested XD

  net:
    -auto.sh
        Put this into cron to increment TTL on load(костыль detected)
        Helps bypassing some lame firewalls
    -monitor.sh
        Creates WiFi adapter interface in monitor mode(simplest way in mint)
    -net.sh
        Same as auto, but designed for adjusting router settings
    -trans.sh
        Simplest interface allows you to transfer files through network
    -unicorn
        If a ICMP ping is allowed, this can be used to tell you a site 
        that was down is working again.

  web:
    -delete.js
        Script you could run to get rid of annoying ads in your browser.
        Add this to bookmarks, click it, put your mouse over 
        /le shitty advertisement/ and double press 'Q' key;
        If you accomplished your goal, it's possible to disable script
        by taping 'W' key.
    -sub.sh
        Requires: Sublist3r
        Creates large subdomains list of pointed in ./addr domains
        Needs r00t to add public DNS-servers, if you think u got 'em 
        just delete first line of script OR run it without sudo accesss.
